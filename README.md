For the Age Ranges 0-17, 18-27, and 30-39, the Relative Risk more than doubled; for 40-49, nearly so. Disturbing, because based on the global data to date, these Age Ranges have the lowest risk of Covid morbidity.

In 2021, biological females in Age Ranges 0-17, 18-29, and 30-39 were 2.5 times MORE likely to die with Covid. To express that in percentages: 278%, 256%, and 259% respectively. Biological males only did comparatively better, but still had noteworthy Relative Risk increases in five of eight Age Ranges.
