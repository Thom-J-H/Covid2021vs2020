## Covid & Other Conditions, 2020 & 2021

Based on the American [CDC data set](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities): “Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths, by State and Age, Provisional 2020-2022, updated on 18 May 2022. The new CDC language is “deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019.” For over 5% of deaths, only the only condition reported was Covid. For the remaining (94% +), an average "4.0 additional conditions or causes per death."

## CDC Age Groups: Mortality Risks, 2020 & 2021

This report makes use of the [American CDC data set](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities) “Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths, by State and Age, Provisional 2020-2022, updated on 11 May 2022. The Age Group 0-24 seems in direct violation of the Age Group ranges endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Because of how the CDC stratified the results, it is difficult to arrive the Covid mortality risks faced by American children. The following graphs work with the data we have – not the data one might wish – to explore the Covid mortality risks faced by American children.

By percentage:

## Relative Risk: 2021 vs. 2020
Based upon CDC data provided by the USA government, this study explores the relative risk of dying with Covid in 2021 as compared to 2020.  Results -- Visualizations and Data Tables -- presented @ <a href ="https://rpubs.com/Thom_JH/Covid_Relative_Risk">Covid in the USA: 2021 vs. 2020</a>.

For the Age Ranges 0-17, 18-27, and 30-39, the Relative Risk more than doubled; for 40-49, nearly so. Disturbing, because based on the global data to date, these Age Ranges have the lowest risk of Covid morbidity.

In 2021, biological females in Age Ranges 0-17, 18-29, and 30-39 were 2.5 times MORE likely to die with Covid. To express that in percentages: 278%, 256%, and 259% respectively. Biological males only did comparatively better, but still had noteworthy Relative Risk increases in five of eight Age Ranges.
